## What is this?

MediQueue solves two real-world healthcare problems in a single platform:

- **CareQueue** — eliminates physical waiting rooms with a real-time digital queue. Patients join remotely, track their position live, and get notified when it's their turn.
- **Health-Vault** — gives patients full ownership of their medical records with consent-based sharing, AES-256-GCM encryption at rest, and an immutable audit trail for every access.

Three user roles — **Patient**, **Doctor**, **Admin** — each with their own dashboard, workflows, and permission boundary.

---

## Technical Highlights

These are the engineering decisions worth talking about:

| Concern | Solution |
|---|---|
| Real-time queue updates | Socket.io v4 rooms (`user:<id>`) — server pushes diffs on every queue state change |
| Medical record security | AES-256-GCM encryption via a dedicated service; key separate from data |
| Authentication | Two-token JWT (15 min access + 7 day refresh) with a two-step OTP registration flow |
| Authorization | Stateless `protect()` + `authorize(...roles)` middleware; no DB hit on every request |
| Audit compliance | Immutable `AuditLog` model; middleware wraps every sensitive admin action automatically |
| Emergency access | Doctors can request override access; all overrides are logged and surfaced to admins for review |
| File uploads | Multer → Cloudinary storage; signed URLs for viewing — raw CDN URLs are never exposed to clients |
| AI triage | Groq LLaMA 3.1 suggests priority from symptoms — human override always preserved, AI is advisory only |
| AI summarization | On-demand PDF text extraction + LLaMA summary — quota-limited, PII-stripped before Groq sees any text |

### Patient
- Register with email/SMS OTP verification (two-step flow)
- Book appointments and join a live queue remotely
- Real-time queue position tracking with estimated wait time
- Upload, view, and delete medical records (encrypted)
- Grant / revoke per-doctor consent to individual records
- View prescriptions from completed consultations
- In-app notification centre with real-time push

- Access patient records (consent-gated or emergency override with justification)
- Write and manage prescriptions
- View shared records and appointment history
- Receive real-time notifications for queue events

### Admin
- Full user management (create, suspend, promote, delete)
- Analytics dashboard — appointments, queue throughput, system usage
- Audit log explorer with filtering (who accessed what, when, why)
- Emergency access review — approve / reject doctor override requests
- Real-time system activity monitoring

### Data Model

![Database ER Diagram](database%20ER%20diagram%20mediqueue.png)

### Key Design Decisions

- **ES Modules** throughout the backend (`"type": "module"`) — native `import`/`export`, no CommonJS.
- **Stateless auth middleware** (`middleware/auth.js`) to keep hot-path requests fast; a separate DB-checking middleware exists only for the auth router.
- **`io` shared via `app.set('io', io)`** — controllers emit real-time events without coupling to the Socket layer.
- **Zustand** persisted to `localStorage` as `auth-storage`; the Axios interceptor reads the token directly from the store shape — no additional auth state duplication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/piyushkumar0707/MediQueue.git
cd MediQueue

# 2. Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env        # fill in MONGODB_URI, JWT secrets, ENCRYPTION_KEY (32 chars), Twilio/email
npm install
npm run dev                 # → http://localhost:5000

# 3. Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env        # set VITE_API_URL and VITE_SOCKET_URL
npm install
npm run dev                 # → http://localhost:5173
```

### Environment Variables (Backend)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | Sign access tokens (short-lived) |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | Sign refresh tokens |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Exactly 32 characters — AES-256 key for medical records |
| `TWILIO_*` | SMS OTP delivery |
| `EMAIL_*` | Email OTP delivery |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq LLaMA 3.1 API key — get free key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). If omitted, AI features degrade silently and the app still starts |
| `AI_FEATURE_TRIAGE` | `true` / `false` — toggle symptom triage without a redeploy (default: `true`) |
| `AI_FEATURE_SUMMARIZE` | `true` / `false` — toggle record summarization without a redeploy (default: `true`) |

> ⚠️ Never change `ENCRYPTION_KEY` after records are stored — existing records become unreadable.

## AI Safety Design

MediQueue integrates Groq LLaMA 3.1 for two advisory features. The design follows a strict **human-in-the-loop** model.

### Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| AI is never a hard dependency | Every AI call is `try/catch` wrapped. Queue join and record view work with Groq completely down or rate-limited |
| Raw medical text never leaves the platform unredacted | A PII redaction pass strips names, emails, phone numbers, and IDs before any text is sent to Groq |
| Final decision always belongs to the user | The backend never reads AI output to set queue priority — it only stores the AI suggestion for audit purposes |
| Every AI action is auditable | `AuditLog` entries are written for every summarize call: who, which record, model, latency, success/fail |
| Features can be toggled independently | `AI_FEATURE_TRIAGE` and `AI_FEATURE_SUMMARIZE` env flags disable either feature without a redeploy |
| Prompt versioning | Every AI call carries a `promptVersion` field (e.g. `triage-v1`, `summary-v1`) for future auditability |

### Symptom Triage Flow

1. Patient types symptoms in the Join Queue form
2. "Suggest priority" button calls `POST /api/queue/triage` (rate-limited: 5 req/min)
3. Groq returns `{ priority, reason, confidence }` — pre-fills the priority selector
4. Patient can override — if they do, `aiOverridden: true` is stored on the queue entry
5. A non-dismissable disclaimer is always shown: *"AI suggests a priority level based on symptoms. This is not a medical diagnosis. A doctor will confirm."*

### Record Summarization Flow

1. Patient opens a PDF record and clicks "Summarize with AI"
2. Backend fetches the PDF from Cloudinary via signed URL, extracts text with `pdf-parse`
3. PII is stripped, text is capped at 12,000 chars, then sent to Groq
4. Response: `{ summary, keyFindings, followUpNeeded }` — displayed in the UI, never stored
5. Per-user quota: max 10 requests/hour (Redis counter)
6. Non-dismissable disclaimer: *"AI-generated summary. Always consult your doctor for medical advice."*

### Graceful Degradation

- `GROQ_API_KEY` missing → app starts normally, AI endpoints return `503` with a clear message
- Groq timeout (8 s) → one automatic retry, then fallback response — core feature still completes
- `AI_FEATURE_*=false` → endpoint returns `503`, no Groq call is made
